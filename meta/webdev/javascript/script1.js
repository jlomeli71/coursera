/* Truthy
In JavaScript, a truthy value is a value that is considered true when encountered in a Boolean context. 
All values are truthy unless they are defined as falsy. That is, all values are truthy except:
- false, 
- 0, 
- -0, 
- 0n, 
- "", 
- null, 
- undefined, 
- NaN,      
- document.all    */

/* Falsy
A falsy (sometimes written falsey) value is a value that is considered false when encountered in a Boolean context.

You are coding an RPG game, where each character has certain skill levels based on the value saved in their score.
- Create a variable named  score and set it to  8
- Use console.log() that includes the string "Mid-level skills:" and compares 
the score variable to above 0 and below 10 using the && operator

You need to code a new variable named timeRemaining and set it to 0. 
You also need to code a new variable named energy and set it to 10.
Next, you should write a piece of code that could be used to determine if the game is over, 
based on whether either the value of the timeRemaining variable is 0 or the value of the energy variable is 0.
Complete the task using the following steps:
- Declare the variable timeRemaining, and assign the value of 0 to it.
- Declare the variable energy, and assign the value of 10 to it.
- Console log the following parameters: "Game over: ", and timeRemaining == 0 || energy == 0

/* Task 3: Using the modulus operator, %, to test if a given number is odd
You need to code a small program that takes a number and determines if it's an even number (like 2, 4, 6, 8, 10).
To achieve this task, you need to declare six variables, as follows:
- The first variable, named num1,  should be assigned a number value of 2.
- The second variable, named num2, should be assigned a number value of 5.
- The third variable, named test1, should be assigned the calculation of num1 % 2. 
  Note: executing this code will return a number.
- The fourth variable, named test2, should be assigned the calculation of num2 % 2. 
  Note: executing this code will also return a number.
- The fifth variable, named result1, should be assigned the result of comparing if the number stored in the 
  test1 variable is equal to 0, in other words, this: test1 == 0.
- The sixth variable, named result2, should be assigned the result of comparing if the number stored in the 
  test2 variable is equal to 0, in other words, test2 == 0.
Run console log two times after you've set the variables:
- The first console log should have the following code between parentheses: "Is", num1, "an even number?", result1
- The second console log should have the following code between parentheses: "Is", num2, "an even number?", result2
Note: The output to the console should be as follows:
Is 2 an even number? true
Is 5 an even number? false  */

var num1 = 2;
var num2 = 5;
var test1 = num1 % 2;
var test2 = num2 % 2;

console.log("Is", num1, "an even number?", result1);
console.log("Is", num2, "an even number?", result2);

/* Task 5: Concatenate numbers and strings using the + operator
Code three variables:
- The first variable should be a string with the following value: "Now in ". Name the variable now.
- The second variable should be a number with the value: 3. Name the variable three.
- The third variable should a string with the following value: "D!". Name the variable d.
- Console log the following code: now + three + d.
Note: The expected output should be: "Now in 3D!".      */
