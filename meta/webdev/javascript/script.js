/* Task 1: Using the logical && operator
You are coding an RPG game, where each character has certain skill levels based on the value saved in their score.
- Create a variable named  score and set it to  8
- Use console.log() that includes the string "Mid-level skills:" and compares 
the score variable to above 0 and below 10 using the && operator
The expected output in the console should be: "Mid-level skills: true". */

var score = 8;
console.log("Mid-level skills:", score > 0 && score < 10);

/* Task 2: Using the logical || operator
Imagine you are coding a video game. Currently, youâ€™re about to code some snippets related to the game over condition.
You need to code a new variable named timeRemaining and set it to 0. 
You also need to code a new variable named energy and set it to 10.
Next, you should write a piece of code that could be used to determine if the game is over, 
based on whether either the value of the timeRemaining variable is 0 or the value of the energy variable is 0.
Complete the task using the following steps:
- Declare the variable timeRemaining, and assign the value of 0 to it.
- Declare the variable energy, and assign the value of 10 to it.
- Console log the following parameters: "Game over: ", and timeRemaining == 0 || energy == 0
Note that the expected output in the console should be: "Game over: true".  */
var timeRemaining = 0;
var energy = 10;
console.log("Game over:", timeRemaining == 0 || energy == 0);

var timeRemaining = 3;
var energy = 10;
console.log("Game over:", timeRemaining == 0 || energy == 0);

/* Task 3: Using the modulus operator, %, to test if a given number is odd
You need to code a small program that takes a number and determines if it's an even number (like 2, 4, 6, 8, 10).
To achieve this task, you need to declare six variables, as follows:
- The first variable, named num1,  should be assigned a number value of 2.
- The second variable, named num2, should be assigned a number value of 5.
- The third variable, named test1, should be assigned the calculation of num1 % 2. 
  Note: executing this code will return a number.
- The fourth variable, named test2, should be assigned the calculation of num2 % 2. 
  Note: executing this code will also return a number.
- The fifth variable, named result1, should be assigned the result of comparing if the number stored in the 
  test1 variable is equal to 0, in other words, this: test1 == 0.
- The sixth variable, named result2, should be assigned the result of comparing if the number stored in the 
  test2 variable is equal to 0, in other words, test2 == 0.
Run console log two times after you've set the variables:
- The first console log should have the following code between parentheses: "Is", num1, "an even number?", result1
- The second console log should have the following code between parentheses: "Is", num2, "an even number?", result2
Note: The output to the console should be as follows:
Is 2 an even number? true
Is 5 an even number? false  */

var num1 = 2;
var num2 = 5;
var test1 = num1 % 2;
var test2 = num2 % 2;
var result1 = test1 == 0;
var result2 = test2 == 0;
console.log("Is", num1, "an even number?", result1);
console.log("Is", num2, "an even number?", result2);
